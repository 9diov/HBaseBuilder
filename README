HBaseBuilder is a Groovy DSL for the HBase client API.  It is somewhat similar to Groovy SQL 
in that it allows convenient iteration over a result set while closing the iterator at the
end.  This also provides a convenient way to add rows and columns to a table in a builder-style
fashion, as well as more streamlined access to HBase's table creation and manipulation 
features.

HBaseBuilder is currently compatible with HBase 0.19.
